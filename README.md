# [NOT CURRENTLY FINISHED GIVE ME A MONTH!]
# GPT-2 Chatbot Fine-Tuning ðŸ¤–
Fine-tuning a pre-trained GPT-2 model for chat and reply tasks. The goal is to adapt the model to generate contextually coherent responses in a conversational setting. This Code takes in Reply and Response

# Requirements
- Python 3.6 or better
- Packages: torch transformers datasets (You can install these packages using `pip install torch transformers datasets`)

# Setup
- Open Terminal
- CD to your desired directory
- Download the repository using `git clone [your-repository-url]`
- Run the script for fine-tuning the GPT-2 model

# Features
- **Torch Debugging for GPU Use**: Leverages PyTorchâ€™s capabilities for debugging and utilizing GPU acceleration.
- **Easy Access to Training**: Simple and customizable training configuration to suit various needs.

# Steps
1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install torch transformers datasets
   ```

2. **Download Pre-trained GPT-2 Model**:
   Load the tokenizer and model from the Hugging Face library.

3. **Prepare Dataset**:
   Create a dataset of context-response pairs for fine-tuning.

5. **Tokenize Dataset**:
   The Code will Auto-Tokenize the context-response pairs to prepare them for model training.

6. **Configure Training**:
   Set up training parameters including batch size, number of epochs, and learning rate.

7. **Train the Model**:
   Utilize GPU acceleration for faster training using PyTorchâ€™s native support.

8. **Save the Model**:
   Save the fine-tuned model for future use and deployment.

The script will guide you through the process, printing the training progress and GPU usage. After the training is complete, the fine-tuned model will be saved to the specified directory.

The fine-tuned model can then be loaded and used to generate responses for given contexts using the `GPT2LMHeadModel` and `GPT2Tokenizer` from the `transformers` library.
